        # Tips 'n Tricks

        Some tips and tricks to make life a bit easier for you...

        #### Try to avoid vertical pan/swipe
        Vertical panning is used to scroll your page, and some (older) browsers don't send events so Hammer isn't
        able to recognize these gestures. An option would be to provide an alternative way to do the same action.

        #### Test on a real device
        Sometimes Hammer just needs some fine-tuning, like the swipe velocity or some other thresholds. Also,
        for better performance your should try to keep you callbacks as simple as possible.
