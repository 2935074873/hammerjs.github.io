        # Emulate touch on a desktop
        A debug tool is available to emulate touch support in the browser. It fires real touch events as
        [specified by W3C](http://www.w3.org/TR/touch-events). When pressing the `shift` key,
        you can also use multi-touch events like pinch and rotate.

        ### Usage
        Using it is simple. Just include the javascript file, and call the `Emulator()` function before
        any other libraries that does something with the touch input.

        ````html
        <script src="../../touch-emulator.js"></script>
        <script> TouchEmulator(); </script>
        ````

        Download the script from the repo, or just run `bower install hammer-touchemulator`.
