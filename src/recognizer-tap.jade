        # Hammer.Tap(options)
        Recognized when the pointer is doing a small tap/click. Multiple taps are recognized if they occur between the given
        interval and position. The delay option can be used to recognize multi-taps without firing a single tap.
        The eventData from the emitted event contains the property `tapCount`, which contains the amount of multi-taps being
        recognized.
